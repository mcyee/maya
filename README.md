# Maya

Maya is a Slack bot user. She doesn't really do anything yet.

## Install

Create a file called `conf.json` and put your API token in it:

    {
        "token": "PUT-TOKEN-HERE"
    }

## Dependencies

The `package.json` exists but this package isn't published.

Please install the [Slack client library for node.js](https://github.com/slackhq/node-slack-client). You might want to install [config.json](https://github.com/bulyshko/config.json) as well.
